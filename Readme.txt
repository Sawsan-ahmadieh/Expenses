Defining project:
Using this project you can save the daily expenses and find the total amount.
The data is saved in an xml file. 
So first you upload the xml file then when you save the changes it will be saved in the xml file opened before. 

Using This program:
After you run the project it asks you for the xml file to be uplaoded. the file is filled with some data for testing.
You can add new data using save button and through the table you can update records.

Filtering: you can filter the displayed records of daily expenses through item name or through duration 
In all cases after filtering the total amount is calculated

Using SQL Server: the commented codes are related to connecting to local sql database,
you can setup and migrate classes and it will work perfectly well
